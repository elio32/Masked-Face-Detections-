This is a Masked Face detection project, where it can detect if someone is wearing their mask "correctty" or "incorrectly". To be identified as "correct", nose, mouth and chin should be covered by them mask, but if either nose, mouth or chin is not covered by the mask, it is identified as "incorrect"
